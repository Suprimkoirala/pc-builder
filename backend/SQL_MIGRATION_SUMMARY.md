# SQL Migration Summary

This document summarizes the complete migration from Django ORM to raw SQL queries in the PC Builder application.

## Overview

The application has been successfully migrated from using Django's Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) to direct SQL queries. This provides better control over database operations and eliminates ORM overhead.

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. New Files Created

#### `backend/pcbuilder/database.py`
- **Purpose**: Core database management and SQL operations
- **Key Classes**:
  - `DatabaseManager`: Handles SQLite connections and query execution
  - `UserDB`: User-related SQL operations
  - `CategoryDB`: Category-related SQL operations
  - `VendorDB`: Vendor-related SQL operations
  - `ComponentDB`: Component-related SQL operations
  - `BuildDB`: Build-related SQL operations
  - `BuildComponentDB`: Build component relationship operations
  - `PublicBuildDB`: Public build operations

#### `backend/pcbuilder/sql_serializers.py`
- **Purpose**: Serializers that work with dictionary data from SQL queries
- **Key Features**:
  - All serializers now work with `dict` objects instead of Django model instances
  - Maintains the same API interface for frontend compatibility
  - Includes proper field validation and type conversion

#### `backend/pcbuilder/auth_backend.py`
- **Purpose**: Custom authentication backend for SQL-based user system
- **Key Features**:
  - Authenticates users using SQL queries instead of Django ORM
  - Creates Django User objects from SQL data for compatibility
  - Supports both email and username authentication

#### `backend/test_sql_system.py`
- **Purpose**: Test script to verify SQL system functionality
- **Tests**: All major database operations (CRUD) for each entity

### 2. Modified Files

#### `backend/pcbuilder/views.py`
- **Changes**:
  - Replaced `ModelViewSet` with `ViewSet` for custom SQL operations
  - Removed all Django ORM queries (`User.objects.all()`, etc.)
  - Added SQL database class instances in `__init__` methods
  - Implemented custom CRUD operations using SQL queries
  - Added proper error handling for SQL operations

#### `backend/pcbuilder/auth_views.py`
- **Changes**:
  - Replaced Django ORM user operations with SQL queries
  - Updated user creation and authentication logic
  - Modified JWT token creation to work with SQL user data
  - Added proper password hashing and verification

#### `backend/pcbuilder/urls.py`
- **Changes**:
  - Added new URL patterns for build component operations
  - Added public builds endpoint
  - Updated imports to use new view classes

#### `backend/config/settings.py`
- **Changes**:
  - Commented out `AUTH_USER_MODEL` setting
  - Added custom authentication backend configuration
  - Maintained Django REST framework settings

## Key SQL Operations Implemented

### User Operations
```sql
-- Get all users
SELECT id, username, email, bio, avatar, is_pro_builder, 
       is_superuser, is_staff, is_active, date_joined
FROM pcbuilder_user;

-- Get user by email
SELECT * FROM pcbuilder_user WHERE email = ?;

-- Create user
INSERT INTO pcbuilder_user (username, email, password, ...) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ...);
```

### Component Operations
```sql
-- Get all components with category and vendor info
SELECT 
    c.id, c.name, c.description, c.price, c.image, 
    c.specs, c.stock, c.category_id, c.vendor_id,
    cat.name as category_name, cat.slug as category_slug,
    v.name as vendor_name, v.website as vendor_website
FROM pcbuilder_component c
JOIN pcbuilder_category cat ON c.category_id = cat.id
JOIN pcbuilder_vendor v ON c.vendor_id = v.id;
```

### Build Operations
```sql
-- Get user builds
SELECT id, user_id, name, description, created, 
       updated, is_public, total_price
FROM pcbuilder_build 
WHERE user_id = ?;

-- Create build
INSERT INTO pcbuilder_build (user_id, name, description, ...) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ...);

-- Update build total price
UPDATE pcbuilder_build 
SET total_price = (
    SELECT COALESCE(SUM(c.price * bc.quantity), 0.00)
    FROM pcbuilder_buildcomponent bc
    JOIN pcbuilder_component c ON bc.component_id = c.id
    WHERE bc.build_id = ?
)
WHERE id = ?;
```

## Benefits of SQL Migration

### 1. Performance
- **Direct SQL queries**: No ORM overhead
- **Optimized JOINs**: Explicit control over query optimization
- **Reduced memory usage**: No Django model instance creation

### 2. Control
- **Query optimization**: Full control over SQL query structure
- **Database-specific features**: Can use SQLite-specific optimizations
- **Transaction management**: Explicit control over database transactions

### 3. Transparency
- **Clear SQL queries**: Easy to understand what's happening in the database
- **Debugging**: Direct SQL queries are easier to debug and profile
- **Documentation**: SQL queries serve as self-documenting code

### 4. Flexibility
- **Custom queries**: Can implement complex queries not easily expressible in ORM
- **Database agnostic**: Can easily switch to other databases by modifying SQL syntax
- **Raw SQL features**: Can use advanced SQL features like window functions, CTEs, etc.

## API Compatibility

The migration maintains full API compatibility:
- **Same endpoints**: All REST API endpoints remain unchanged
- **Same request/response format**: JSON structure is identical
- **Same authentication**: JWT authentication works the same way
- **Same serialization**: Response format is identical to ORM version

## Testing

The system has been tested with:
- ✅ User creation and authentication
- ✅ Component listing and retrieval
- ✅ Build creation and management
- ✅ Build component relationships
- ✅ Price calculations
- ✅ Public build listings

## Migration Verification

Run the test script to verify the system:
```bash
cd backend
python test_sql_system.py
```

Expected output:
```
✅ All SQL operations completed successfully!
```

## Next Steps

1. **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor query performance in production
2. **Query Optimization**: Further optimize complex queries if needed
3. **Database Indexing**: Add appropriate indexes for frequently queried fields
4. **Connection Pooling**: Consider implementing connection pooling for high traffic
5. **Query Logging**: Add SQL query logging for debugging and optimization

## Rollback Plan

If needed, the system can be rolled back to ORM by:
1. Restoring original `views.py` and `auth_views.py`
2. Removing SQL-specific files (`database.py`, `sql_serializers.py`, `auth_backend.py`)
3. Restoring original `settings.py` configuration
4. Re-enabling `AUTH_USER_MODEL` setting

## Conclusion

The migration to raw SQL queries has been completed successfully. The application now uses direct SQL operations while maintaining full API compatibility and improving performance. All existing functionality has been preserved and enhanced with better database control.
